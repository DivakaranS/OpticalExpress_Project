Optical Store Sales Project
This project is designed to enhance sales for an optical store by providing exclusive discounts to privilege customers. Customers who hold a privilege membership card receive special offers and discounts, which are communicated through WhatsApp ads and promotional messages. The goal is to foster customer loyalty and encourage repeat purchases by making privilege members feel valued and motivated to visit the store regularly.
Key Features
Discounts for Privilege Members: Exclusive deals for loyalty cardholders.
WhatsApp Promotions: Direct communication of offers via WhatsApp ads to ensure customers are informed about new discounts.
Repeat Purchase Incentive: Promotes ongoing engagement with the store through privilege membership benefits.
